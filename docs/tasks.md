- description: "Extend packages/cq-cli/src/main.ts: add `advance-gate` to SUBCOMMANDS, USAGE, parser, and HANDLERS, implementing runAdvanceGate in a new ./advanceGate.ts. It constructs the fs-backed store IN-PROCESS via createLedgerStore(args.cwd) (exactly like runInit/runReset/move-ledger — NO MCP server), calls derivePredicates(store), disposes, and decides: compute the session-keyed marker path `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/cq-advance-active-<session-id>` (session id from a --session flag or $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID). If the marker is ABSENT → allow (block=false). If present, grep its contents for a non-empty `external-signal: \"...\"` line → allow. Else if any predicate is TRUE-and-unblocked → block=true with reason `P-<which>=TRUE and unblocked; continue per D41 — turn-pause is not a stop condition`; else allow. Emit on stdout the NEUTRAL (harness-agnostic) JSON `{ block, reason, predicates: { pInvestigate, pPlan, pImplement, openQuestionGate } }`; exit 0 = allow, non-zero = block (Q199). The CLI itself emits NO Claude-Code {decision} JSON — that is the wrapper's job (T7)."

The Stop hook receives the session id on stdin/env; the wrapper reads $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, invokes `cq advance-gate --session <id> --cwd <ledger-root>` capturing stdout+exit, and: if exit is NON-ZERO (block) prints to stdout the Claude-Code hook JSON `{\"decision\":\"block\",\"reason\":<the gate's reason>}`; otherwise prints nothing / `{}` (allow the stop). Marker-absent / external-signal / all-FALSE all flow through as allow because the CLI already returned exit 0. Keep the wrapper minimal + harness-specific (the neutral CLI stays reusable by other harnesses per D50's LIMITS); no $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID → allow (exit 0)."
- acceptance: "The wrapper script exists in claude.nix and the home-manager/dev-llm build (or `nix flake check`) evaluates without error; the script invokes `cq advance-gate` and emits {decision:block,reason} ONLY on a non-zero gate exit, allow otherwise.

KEEP the existing D41 turn-pause prose / euphemism blocklist / self-check intact as the documented fallback for non-Claude harnesses, ADDING one sentence that the Stop hook now mechanically enforces it for Claude Code. Do NOT touch the sub-commands. Re-run gen-agents-catalogue (freshness guard)."
- acceptance: advance.md contains the marker-drop step in §Bootstrap, the atomic marker-unlink in §The one write/§End-of-run, and the hook + external-signal cross-reference in §Stop-condition gate; D41 prose retained + the enforcement sentence added; diff confined to those sections; sub-commands untouched; agentsCatalogue regen no drift; bun run check green.

- headline: Integration test of the Stop-hook wrapper's stdout/exit contract against a stub gate
- description: "Per Q204 item (2): add a test (subprocess-based; under cq-cli/test or a dedicated hook test) that invokes the wrapper script with the `cq` binary STUBBED/shimmed (via PATH) to return: (a) exit non-zero + neutral verdict JSON with a reason → assert the wrapper's stdout is exactly `{\"decision\":\"block\",\"reason\":\"P-… continue per D41 …\"}`; (b) exit 0 → assert the wrapper ALLOWS (empty/`{}` stdout, no block). Drive the session id + marker path via env so the test is hermetic. Covers the hook-wrapper stdout/exit contract independent of the live harness."
- acceptance: "The integration test runs the wrapper against a stubbed gate and asserts {decision:block} on non-zero exit + allow on exit 0; green in bun run check (or the documented hook-test command)."

- headline: Add a grep-invariant test pinning the new advance.md marker + external-signal steps (mirror D39's guard)
- description: "Per Q204: add a test (mirror D39's advance.md prose grep-invariant — locate the existing advance.md/agentsCatalogue guard test and extend or add beside it) asserting advance.md still contains the load-bearing enforcement steps: the marker-drop in §Bootstrap, the marker-unlink coupled with the terminal-handoff write, the external-signal escape format `external-signal:`, the Stop-hook cross-reference in §Stop-condition gate, and the `mcp__ledger__derive_predicates` detection instruction. Prevents silent prose regression of the enforcement steps exactly as D39 guarded its handoff prose."
- acceptance: A grep-invariant test FAILS if any of the marker-drop / marker-unlink / external-signal / hook-cross-ref / derive_predicates strings are removed from advance.md, and PASSES on the edited file; bun run check green.

- headline: "Document the manual repro + capture the live /cq:advance Stop-hook firing evidence"
- description: "Per Q204 (strongest bar): (1) write a documented manual repro under docs/drafts/ — drop the marker, leave a TRUE-and-unblocked predicate in the ledger, attempt to end a turn, observe the Stop hook return {decision:block} + force continuation; include exact commands + observed-vs-expected output. (2) Record a LIVE /cq:advance session demonstrating the hook firing end-to-end (the hook blocking a premature turn-pause while a predicate is TRUE), captured as a transcript/log committed under docs/logs or docs/drafts — manual evidence, explicitly NOT a CI gate. Note the accepted irreducible behavioural limit (the hook forces continuation; it cannot make a genuinely exhausted model productive — the external-signal escape covers the real case). This task is the live-evidence capstone; it depends on the whole gate being wired + registered."
- acceptance: A docs/ artifact contains the reproducible manual-repro commands+output AND a recorded live-session transcript showing the Stop hook firing (block decision) on a TRUE-and-unblocked predicate; the doc states the accepted behavioural limit.
