    summary: "Dogfood complete: T24 driven to done through the real implement-flow loop (manual worktree (K4 Codex path) -> implement-worker created+committed the marker -> bun run check green in worktree (379 pass) -> implement-reviewer approved 0/0 -> ff merge-back into throwaway dogfood/base). Throwaway branches deleted; nothing landed on main. Two setup findings recorded as defects under goals:G1."
  - id: M2
    path: ./archive/milestones/M2.md
    summary: TUI + web UI improvements — complete. Per-ledger counts (T1), answer-and-resolve for questions (T2), view persistence (T3), embedded in-process MCP mode for ledger-tui + ledger-web (T17–T22), question-detail field order + highlighted recommendation (T23). Decision K2 (in-process = co-locate the MCP server, don't bypass MCP). Defect D1 (web counts undefined) resolved. Shipped on main (commits 63df0f3, 5cf4916; merged b510170).
  - id: M3
    path: ./archive/milestones/M3.md
    summary: Build /implement:* command family (goal G1) — complete.

Shipped on main (commit 4f430b3).

    summary: Plan-flow maintenance — complete. Subagent MCP tool access made server-name-independent via denylist (T13); /plan:follow-up command + goal re-open transitions, decision K5 (T25); /plan:advance with no argument advances all unlocked goals (T14).
