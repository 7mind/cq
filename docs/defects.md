- headline: ledger-mcp fails to connect in a directory with no initialized ledger (should auto-init)
- severity: major
- description: "MCP connection fails when an agent (Claude Code / Codex) starts in a directory that has NO initialized ledger — i.e. no docs/ ledger state / no docs/ledgers.yaml present. The `@cq/ledger-mcp` server fails to connect/serve instead of degrading gracefully, so the session has no ledger tools. Desired behavior: instead of failing, automatically initialize the canonical ledger set (init the ledgers) on startup so the MCP connection succeeds in a fresh directory. Investigate the root cause — where/why the server errors on missing ledger state, what \"initialized\" means (which files/dirs are required), whether `--cwd` resolution or a missing docs/ledgers.yaml is the trigger, and where an auto-init hook should live (server startup vs store construction) — then seed fix tasks. Severity: major (blocks using the tool in any uninitialized repo; workaround = manually init the ledger files)."
- rootCause: "ledger-mcp aborts at startup with BootstrapViolationError ('existing <ledger> ledger has a different schema than its canonical bootstrap schema') thrown by FsLedgerStore.init() (packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts:283-289) when an EXISTING on-disk ledger's schema diverges from its CANONICAL_LEDGERS bootstrap schema. main() (packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts:337-344) awaits store.init() BEFORE serving, so the throw crashes the process before the MCP handshake → client sees 'connection failed'. NOT a missing-init problem (the empty-dir auto-init path works). The divergence is a version-skew artifact (stale built/global binary vs evolved docs/ledgers.yaml, or vice-versa). Confirmed by the user's verbatim runtime error (hypothesis H4, parent H3)."
- suggestedFix: "Replace the fatal throw with a graceful BACKUP-AND-REINIT: when FsLedgerStore.init() detects a schema divergence for an existing ledger (the schemasEqual==false branch), instead of throwing BootstrapViolationError, (a) move/copy the divergent on-disk ledger file(s) (and docs/ledgers.yaml) into a timestamped backup location (e.g. docs/.backup/<ISO-timestamp>/), then (b) write fresh canonical ledger(s) + registry from CANONICAL_LEDGERS and continue startup. Surface a loud WARNING (stderr) naming the backup path so no data is silently lost. Consider a guard/opt-out flag if a non-destructive abort is ever wanted, but default to backup-and-reinit per the user. Add tests: a seeded divergent on-disk schema → init() backs up + reinitializes + serves (no throw); backup dir contains the prior files."
- dependsOn: ["T94","T95","T96","T97"]
- fix: "Backup-and-reinit on schema divergence (replaces the fatal BootstrapViolationError): T94 (0d66e33) backupAndReinit helper (timestamped docs/.backup/, ENOENT-tolerant copy of prior files, fresh canonical + stderr WARNING); T95 (a26104b) rewired FsLedgerStore.init() !schemasEqual branch to backup-and-reinit BY DEFAULT (collects the divergent set, mutates this.registry in place to canonical) + onSchemaDivergence:'abort' opt-out preserving the throw; T96 (844d240) tests (divergence→backup+reinit / abort / no-divergence / empty-dir) + migrated the 6 divergence-guard cases to the abort opt-out; T97 repo-gate green. ledger-mcp no longer crashes the MCP handshake on a stale/divergent on-disk schema — it backs up + reinitializes and serves. NOTE: a stale already-running GLOBAL binary still needs a rebuild (out of scope, captured in G4). Integration check 659 green."
